<h1 align="center"> Hello! I'm Ege Ural</h1>

<p align="center"> 
👋 Hi! I'm Ege, a computer science student at Bilkent University who's just getting started with coding. I'm passionate about learning and excited to explore the world of programming.

🖥️ Currently, I'm diving into the basics of coding.I'm eager to build my skills and tackle new challenges along the way.

🏀 Outside of coding, I enjoy playing basketball, tennis, and participating in triathlons. When I'm not on the court or in front of my computer, you can usually find me listening to music or catching up on the latest movies.

🌟 I'm looking forward to connecting with others in the GitHub community, learning from experienced developers, and working on cool projects together. Let's code and have fun!
